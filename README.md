Introduction of the project
Due to the increasing interactions among big cities in North America and also the increasing restrictions on H1B for foreign workers. It seems to be increasingly popular to relocate, or to expand businesses in different areas. So in this project, we aim to provide some information for people who would like to relocate between Toronto and New York, both as the financial center of Canada and US, by determine what are the best pairing boroughs in Toronto and New York. This analysis on the similarity of two boroughs of the two cities should should benefit the following people:

 - working class who'd like to relocate, to find the best area for living/work

 - business people: better make decisions in terms of store selection when making expansion plans

 - any city dwellers who are willing to exploring the simiar community in the other city
 
 Method used: matrix of Euclidean Distances (best match determined as smallest distance)
 
 Interesting findings:
 
 - Queens	--> North York  
 - Staten Island	--> East York
